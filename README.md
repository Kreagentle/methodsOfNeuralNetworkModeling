It is necessary to solve a problem with an unknown dependence of the right side of the parabolic equation using numerical methods and RBF neural networks and their various modifications, present the results in the form of graphs and tables, and compare the data obtained. After the comparison, it is required to provide conclusions about the quality of the algorithms and the choice of the most optimal of those participating in the comparison.

It can be seen that in the case of the best approximation when using numerical methods, that is, with Î´=0.001, the root-mean-square error is 0.2700572637800127. At the same time, in the case of the best approximation using the radial basis neural network, the root mean square error is 0.005845476427815134. If you pay attention to the deviations, it is noticeable that the percentage of deviations in the case of a neural network is much less than in the case of numerical methods. Therefore, taking into account the results obtained, we can conclude that the neural network worked more accurately.
